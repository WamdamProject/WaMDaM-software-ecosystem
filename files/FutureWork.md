# Future work and aspirations towards a community involvement      

The design of WaMDaM and its quest towards generality have limitations in these six areas which constitute opportunities for future work.     
1. The identified six use cases are examples and do not necessarily cover the complexity of the domain of systems water management nor they cover all the possibilities of how the community of users want to use data.    

2. The reviewed data systems and the key features are not necessarily comprehensive of the large inventory of existing systems and the complexity of their data.   


3. The used twelve data sources are example datasets and do not necessarily represent the diversity of used data in the field.  
 
4. The example controlled vocabulary are preliminary and need a robust method on how to define and expand them. Future work may test and improve WaMDaM abilities to work with a larger set of use cases, models, and data sources in other study areas. With a larger set of data, future work is needed to create a more robust method to define, relate, specify terms for water management data and expand the list of available vocabularies similar to the work on semantic annotation for hydrologic sciences by Piasecki and Beran (2009).   


5. The designed tools to support loading data into WaMDaM database are basic and require further testing and improvement to be more user-friendly.  

6. SQLite database and the WaMDaM Wizard in a desktop setting allow one user to store and access data at a time. Future work may build a software ecosystem to allow multiple users to store, access, visualize, and share data using a suite of webservers and tools. Such ecosystem would need to define a standardized machine-readable data encoding method to exchange data over the web and between models. 

Building additional data importers into WaMDaM would speed data loading and validations in WaMDaM and thus enable larger data integration and discovery. Further participation by others will expand usefulness of a future WaMDaM data system.
