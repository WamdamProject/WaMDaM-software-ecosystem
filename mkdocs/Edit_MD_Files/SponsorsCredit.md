## Funding
WaMDaM and related software designs have been developed under funding from several different sources. It was primarily supported by the National Science Foundation [(NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov/) under the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1135482" target="_blank">CI-Water Project</a> grant 1135482 and later from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1208732" target="_blank">iUtah Project</a> under Grant 1208732. 
[Utah Water Research Lab](http://uwrl.usu.edu/) at Utah State University, Logan Utah provided additional funding through Mineral Lease Funds.
