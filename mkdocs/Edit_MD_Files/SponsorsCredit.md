## Funding
WaMDaM and related software designs have been developed under funding from several different sources. It was primarily supported by the National Science Foundation [(NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov/) under the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1135482" target="_blank">CI-Water Project</a> grant 1135482 and later from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1208732" target="_blank">iUtah Project</a> under Grant 1208732. 
[Utah Water Research Lab](http://uwrl.usu.edu/) at Utah State University, Logan Utah provided additional funding through Utah Mineral Lease Funds.

Special thanks to the [ODM2](http://www.odm2.org/) team for promoting #OpenScience by publishing their source code. There is no doubt that WaMDaM development has benefited from the ideas and tools used in ODM2.


Adel Abdallah appreciates the hospitality of Steve Burian and his <a href="http://urbanwater.utah.edu/home" target="_blank"> Urban Water Research Group </a> at the <a href="http://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Utah </a>, Salt Lake City for hosting him as a Visiting Scholar during 2014-2018 while developing WaMDaM. Adel also enjoyed being part of the 
[Global Change & Sustainability Center](https://environment.utah.edu/
) and has learned much from their interdisciplinary Seminar Series.


## Programmers
These talented people helped in implementing and testing different aspects of the pseudocode of the WaMDaM Wizard and adapting the controlled vocabulary system. Stephanie Reeder and Pabitra Dash provided valuable insights into the early design architecture.
