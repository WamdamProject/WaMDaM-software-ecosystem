## Funding :thumbsup:
WaMDaM and related software designs have been developed under funding from several different sources. It was primarily supported by the National Science Foundation [(NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov/) under the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1135482" target="_blank">CI-Water Project</a> grant 1135482 and later from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1208732" target="_blank">iUtah Project</a> under Grant 1208732. 
[Utah Water Research Lab](http://uwrl.usu.edu/) at Utah State University, Logan Utah provided additional funding through Utah Mineral Lease Funds. 


## Acknowledgment :pray:

The WaMDaM work presented here represents a six-year effort with coordination and discussions with water resources engineers and modelers who are similarly trying to advance water modeling and data capabilities.  

The following people at eight institutions provided valuable feedback and insights into earlier designs and materials, they shared models and datasets, or exchanged informal discussions on WaMDaM design and its software at different stages of its development.   

1. **Utah Water Research Laboratory and Utah State University**   
David Tarboton, Jeffery Horsburgh, Pabitra Dash, Toney Castronova, Stephanie Reeder     

2. **University of Manchester, UK**     
Julien Harou, Stephen Knox, and Philipp Meier

3. **University of California, Davis**   
Josue Medellin-Azuara, Quinn Hart, Jay Lund

4. **University of Massachusetts Amherst**    
David Rheinheimer  

5. **Utah Division of Water Resources**  
Craig Miller

6. **University of Utah**   
Steve Burian, Erfan Goharian     

7. **University of Wyoming**   
Fred Ogden, Yoshiyuki Zen Igarashi 

8. **Brigham Young University, Utah**   
Dan Ames, Nathan Swain



Special thanks to the [ODM2](http://www.odm2.org/) team for promoting #OpenScience by publishing their source code. There is no doubt that WaMDaM development has benefited from the ideas and tools used in ODM2.


Adel M. Abdallah appreciates the hospitality of Steve Burian and his <a href="http://urbanwater.utah.edu/home" target="_blank"> Urban Water Research Group </a> at the <a href="http://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Utah </a>, Salt Lake City for hosting him as a Visiting Scholar during 2014-2018 while developing WaMDaM. Adel also enjoyed being part of the 
[Global Change & Sustainability Center](https://environment.utah.edu/
) and has learned much from their interdisciplinary Seminar Series. :coffee:


## Programmers :clap:
These talented developers helped in implementing and testing different aspects of the pseudocode of the WaMDaM Wizard and adapting the controlled vocabulary system. Stephanie Reeder and Pabitra Dash provided valuable insights into the early design architecture.
