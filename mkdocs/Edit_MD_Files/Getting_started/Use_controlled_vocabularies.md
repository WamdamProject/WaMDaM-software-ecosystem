# WaMDaM Controlled Vocabularies

Check out the [WaMDaM online moderated registry][1] that is used to promote consistent terminology (i.e., Controlled Vocabularies-(CVs)) to describe water system components and their attributes across datasets, models, and users, while still retaining the native terms.  

Registering your model's native terms against these CVs will allow you to relate, query, and compare all of your water management data within a single database.
