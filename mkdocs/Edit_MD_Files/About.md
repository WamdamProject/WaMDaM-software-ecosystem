## [How to use it?](/Getting_started/Steps)
The WaMDaM Wizard is a desktop data loader from a spreadsheet template to SQLite or MySQL databases

It enables users to manage and integrate data: CUAHSI time series data, network connectivity, water rights, hydropower, cost, seasonal data, multi-dimension arrays. WaMDaM does not replace existing specialized data systems but rather it brings their data together for the use in water management models
