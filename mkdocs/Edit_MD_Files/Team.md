## The WaMDaM Team

WaMDaM deveopment has been led by Adel Abdallah for his PhD dissertation at Utah Water Research Lab, Utah State University under the advising of Dr. David Rosenberg.  

The timing, availability of funding, expertise, and passion for WaMDaM development were incredible by all means. We were encouraged by a great interest from national and international scientists and practitioners in standardizing the way we communicate systems water management data.
