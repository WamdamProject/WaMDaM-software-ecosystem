# Open Source

WaMDaM is an [open-source][1] and open-science project under the [BSD 3-Clause License](/License). We invite the systems modeling and hydroinformatics communities to use, experiment with, and provide feedback on WaMDaM.   

All source-code and documentations are available on the [WaMDaM Project GitHub](https://github.com/WamdamProject/WaMDaM-software-ecosystem)

Ultimately we aspire to improve WaMDaM and work towards the goal of developing a standard to share and publish systems water management data.
